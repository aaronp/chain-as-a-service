# Digital Signing with Entity Authority (via vLEI)

üéØ Goal
1. Allow a user to sign a document or message, and allow a verifier to:
2. Confirm the user‚Äôs identity
3. Confirm the user is authorized to act on behalf of a legal entity
4. Confirm the entity is valid and globally recognized (via LEI)


üß± Actors
| Actor | Description | 
|-------|-------------|
|Issuer|Issues a vLEI credential to the representative
|Legal Entity | Has an LEI and DID
|Representative | Has a DID and a role VC (e.g., CFO of ACME Ltd)
|Verifier | Verifies a signed payload and the credential chain



# PoC

üß© PoC Structure
1. vLEI Issuance (Simulated)
Generate a DID for the Legal Entity

Generate a DID for the Representative

Create a Verifiable Credential (VC):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "LegalEntityvLEI"],
  "issuer": "did:example:gleif",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:example:rep123",
    "lei": "5493001KJTIIGC8Y1R12",
    "legalName": "ACME Ltd",
    "role": "Chief Financial Officer",
    "represents": "did:example:acme"
  },
  "proof": {
    "type": "JwtProof2020",
    "jwt": "<signed-JWT>"
  }
}
2. Message Signing
The representative signs a message like:

bash
Copy
Edit
"I approve transfer of $5M from ACME Ltd to XYZ Corp."
Use did-jwt or @veramo/core to sign it with their DID key

3. Verification
The verifier checks:

Check	Method
‚úÖ Signature is valid	Validate the JWT or JWS signature
‚úÖ Signer is DID holder	Resolve DID Document, verify public key
‚úÖ Signer has vLEI VC	Decode and validate Verifiable Credential
‚úÖ vLEI VC is valid	Check issuer (GLEIF or simulated CA), expiration, signature
‚úÖ Role & entity match	Confirm role and LEI match expected legal entity

üõ† Discrete Technical Steps
Here‚Äôs how you could implement this in a minimal TypeScript PoC:

üîê Step 1: Generate DIDs
Use [@veramo/core] or [did:key]

ts
Copy
Edit
const { agent } = await createVeramoAgent(); // or generate keypair manually
const did = await agent.didManagerCreate();
üìú Step 2: Issue a VC (vLEI Credential)
Use [did-jwt-vc] or Veramo:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { createVerifiableCredentialJwt } from 'did-jwt-vc';

const vcJwt = await createVerifiableCredentialJwt({
  sub: repDid,
  nbf: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  vc: {
    '@context': ['https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1'],
    type: ['VerifiableCredential', 'LegalEntityvLEI'],
    credentialSubject: {
      lei: '5493001KJTIIGC8Y1R12',
      legalName: 'ACME Ltd',
      role: 'Chief Financial Officer',
      represents: acmeDid
    }
  }
}, issuer);
‚úçÔ∏è Step 3: Sign a Message
ts
Copy
Edit
const message = "I approve transfer of $5M from ACME Ltd to XYZ Corp.";

const signed = await agent.createVerifiablePresentation({
  presentation: {
    holder: repDid,
    verifiableCredential: [vcJwt],
    type: ['VerifiablePresentation'],
  },
  proofFormat: 'jwt',
  challenge: 'random-challenge',
});
üîç Step 4: Verify Everything
ts
Copy
Edit
const result = await agent.verifyPresentation({
  presentation: signed,
  challenge: 'random-challenge',
});
console.log(result.verified); // true if all checks pass
üß™ Outcome
This simple PoC shows:

How a real person can digitally assert authority on behalf of a legal entity

How another party can verify the claim using only the credentials and DIDs ‚Äî no central lookup or phone call required
